## Project Overview
This project is an interactive Power BI dashboard built using the Adventure Works dataset.  
The goal of the analysis is to understand **sales performance**, identify **key revenue drivers**, and highlight **trends and patterns** that can support business decision-making.

The dashboard is designed to give stakeholders a clear overview of performance while still allowing deeper exploration through filters and drill-downs.

## Business Questions
This analysis focuses on answering the following questions:
- How is overall sales and profit performing?
- Which product categories and products generate the most revenue?
- How do sales trends change over time?
- Which regions and customer segments perform best?

## Key Insights
- Sales are heavily driven by a small number of high-performing product categories
- Sales performance varies across time periods, showing clear trends and seasonality
- Regional analysis reveals differences in performance, highlighting potential areas for growth and improvement
- Interactive exploration helps identify both strong performers and underperforming segments

## Data Preparation & Modeling
- Cleaned and transformed raw data using **Power Query**
- Removed unnecessary fields to improve clarity and performance
- Built a structured data model using fact and dimension tables
- Created and managed relationships to ensure accurate reporting
